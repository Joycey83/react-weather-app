# Weather Application - React

The Weather Application was created for the Shecodes React Project

## Introduction

A simple weather application that displays the current weather and six days forecast based on the users search.

[View the live project here.](https://myreactweatherapp88.netlify.app/)

My approach for designing this Weather application was to create it so that it is not only accessible to view on desktop but it is also mobile responsive. The applicaion is also accessible through a range of different devices.

# Deployment

## Deploy a project to Netlify

This site was deployed to Netlify. Plese follow these steps to deploy your site:

One way to get started deploying on Netlify is to use a Deploy to Netlify button to add a site.

1.Select the Deploy to Netlify button.

You will get directed to the Netlify app to create a new site. You should find the following page, asking you to connect to GitHub.

2.Select Connect to GitHub to authenticate. If you don’t already have a Netlify user account, you will get one as part of this process.

3.Select Save & Deploy. As well as creating a new site on Netlify, this process clones the demo project repository to your GitHub account so you can make your own changes later on.

You will be redirected to the Site overview page where you can check for the deploy in the Production deploys list.
